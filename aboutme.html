               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p><strong>August 26, 2016:</strong> The day I moved up from Texas was, at the time, the worst day of my life. It felt like my world fell apart and I couldn't hold it together.</p>
               <p> It wasn't until I made friends and started to understand that it wasn't a halt on my life, but a new beginning that I started to live again and spread my wings. I developed new skills and learned new hobbies to make my life here easier. I started playing D&D regularly and that also helped deepen my stroy writing goals. </p>

                   <li>Discovering PC gaming</li>

                   <li>Trying to DM for a game for the first time</li>
               </ul>
               <p>These individual instances helped froge that is the steel trap of my fantasy knowledge. It was crafted and is what I use in every game I play and create.</p>
