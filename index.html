               <h2>About Me</h2>
               <p><strong>August 25, 2002:</strong> I was born, the earth shook and I alone stood still. No but for real, I was born in Texas and lived 14 years of my life there. I learned to walk, talk and grew into a young man in those hot summers. Though, it wasn't until I moved to Hamiltion, Ohio that I learned what it was to be <emp>loved by another, trusted by friends and even the stong of betrayal.</emp></p>
               <p>When I came to Ohio I was mad and confused. My mom took me from my friends and what I knew. I was alone and sad. I eventually found friends and learned how to live in the new enviornment. </p>


               <h2>My Dreams and Accolades</h2>
               <p>As long as I can remember I have wanted to write worlds and create stories, <strong>Dungeons & Dragons</strong>, <strong>The Hobbit</strong> and <strong>Cyberpunk</strong> have played a big role in upsizing my story/world building mindset. My designs include:</p>
               <ul>
                   <li>The Regicides: D&D Campaign Setting</li>
                   <li>Aurora City of Dreams: Cyberpunk RED Setting</li>
                   <li>Igrimel: Descent into Chaos (D&D World)</li>
                   <li>Equivilant Exchange: Alchemic Card Game</li>
               </ul>

               <p>Not all of these projects have seen total completion but they are being worked on or have been delayed due to scheduling issues.</p>
